Hello!       
My name is Cristóbal Lecaros C.  
I got my Medical Doctor (MD) degree from [Universidad de Antofagasta](http://www.uantof.cl/), and also I hold a Master in Biomedical Informatics (MBI) from [Universidad de Chile](https://cimt.uchile.cl/). I am living in Santiago de Chile doing my clinical work (i.e., ER shifts, inpatient & outpatient care) at [Clínica Indisa](https://www.indisa.cl/), and my research work at [Dermacross](https://www.dermacross.cl/).  
I like skin diseases research. I am currently involved as a Sub-Investigator in some clinical trials evaluating biological drugs for atopic dermatitis, prurigo nodularis, alopecia areata, and chronic spontaneous urticaria. I am also collaborating with the [Global Psoriasis Atlas](https://globalpsoriasisatlas.org/) Project to study the burden of psoriasis in Chile.  
I am keen to collaborate or to participate in any further academic activities or projects.  
 Please don't hesitate to contact me ✌️.

**Interests**: Skin diseases, Randomized Clinical Trials, Statistical Programming (`R`), Reproducible Research, Clinical Informatics  



### Projects
#### 2020
- [The incidence of psoriasis in Chile. An analysis of the national Waiting List Repository](
https://globalpsoriasisatlas.org/).
  Project under development thanks to the GPA initiative. In this study, we examined the referrals made by general practitioners requesting evaluation for new psoriasis cases in Chile during 2016-2017.\

- [Psoriasis in Latin America: a scoping review and bibliometric analysis](
  https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UMZS8).
  There is a relevant gap in the knowledge of psoriasis in Latin America. There are almost no population-level figures of the disease's frequency in the region, and the scientific production during the last thirty years has been sparse and scarce. To understand disparities in psoriasis care associated with ethnicity, we require to identify the types of available evidence and look for critical concepts regarding research of psoriasis in Latin America. This scoping review and bibliometric analysis aim to summarize the extent, range, and nature of the knowledge domain of psoriasis and Latin American ethnicity. The research questions that will guide the present study are: 1. What is known about psoriasis and Latin America? 2. What is the intellectual structure of psoriasis research in Latin America?\
